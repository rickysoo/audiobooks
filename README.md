# Top 100 Audiobooks

Would you like to know the top 100 audiobooks on the Internet whenever you want? I would love to!

I'm a big fan of audio books, having been a paying subscriber to Audible.com for many years.

In this R notebook, we will retrieve the current 100 bestsellers on Audible.com and save them into a dataframe.

For this to work, 5 publicly available web pages are retrieved from Audible.com web site for further processing.
